<p>You might have seen a commit like that in a git checkout somewhere
near you.</p>
<p>Did it feel wrong? It did to me. Why? I’ll try to answer. For myself.</p>
<p>Let’s put aside whether it works or not. We can have similar discussion
on whether yelling works or not with people. And that is not what
this text is about.</p>
<p>First objection to “feeling wrong” is that AI (as we know it now) does
not (and can not) mind, be offended, scared, or otherwise negatively
influenced in a way that a person would. It even tells you so itself
when asked so. (Most likely, unless prompted otherwise.)</p>
<p>But even considering that, it still does not feel right. Reflecting
upon the feeling, I tried to understand why. Writing things ALL CAPS
is how yelling is often represented (in my current cultural context) in text.
So as I’m writing things all caps, my brain is decoding it as yelling.
Text and source code blends with AI. It is easy to distinguish
when I’m talking computer vs human when writing Python/Haskell/…
With AI it is less so.</p>
<p>Practice does not make perfect: it makes permanent. And practicing
yelling may make it a muscle memory when writing text, that
might also manifest itself when dealing with people. And
because of the continuous evaluation, also in non-text interactions.
These small acts of verbal violence matter. Not because the AI feels them,
but because I do them.</p>
<p>But let’s say I can train myself to see ALL CAPS as a markup of
sorts: Similar to seeing <em>italic</em> in <code>*italic*</code>,
seeing <strong>bold</strong> in <code>**bold**</code>, seeing čerešňa in <code>\v{c}ere\v{s}\v{n}a</code>,
and so on. And let’s say I’ll be able to differentiate whether
words that I write are meant for a person or for computer.</p>
<p>And there is a precedent for that. Even when writing
code in traditional programming languages, the code will likely look
different based on whether it is meant to be compiled/interpreted
or whether it is meant to be read by a human. Is it meant
to be a study material? A proof of concept? An expression
of idea shared between domain experts or researchers?</p>
<p>Even with that in mind it still does not feel right.</p>
<p>Text is how we pass down not only information, but also
culture. What is normal, expected, allowed, desired, legal, …
and what is not. To our colleagues, to our future selves,
and to those who might come after us.</p>
<p>By using language in certain ways we are capturing present
to become future’s past, and that way shaping the future.
And I don’t want to be creating future where yelling
is how things are achieved.</p>
<p>More thoughts on the topic have not taken concrete form in my mind yet.
I might add something later.</p>
