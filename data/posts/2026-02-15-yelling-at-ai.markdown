You might have seen a commit like that in a git checkout somewhere
near you.

Did it feel wrong? It did to me. Why? I'll try to answer. For myself.

Let's put aside whether it works or no. We could ask the same question about
yelling at people, but that's a different conversation.

The first objection raised when I discuss this topic (with matrix-based and
meat-based minds alike) is that AI (as we know it now) does not (and cannot)
mind, be offended, get scared, or be otherwise negatively influenced in a way
that a person would.

But even considering that, it still does not feel right. I tried to understand
why. Writing in ALL CAPS is how yelling is represented (in my current cultural
context). So as I type in all caps, my brain decodes it as yelling.

Boundary between text and source code blurs with AI. With Python, Haskell,
sed, or other traditional programming languages the difference in form makes
it easy to tell computer-speak from human-speak. With AI, even when you
know you are writing for a machine, part of your brain still registers ALL
CAPS as yelling. For a reader that context might vanish completely,
all they see is the caps.

Practice does not make perfect: it makes permanent. Practicing yelling builds
muscle memory. That pattern can leak beyond writing for AI. It can fire when
you're writing to people, speaking to them, existing around them. These small
acts of verbal violence matter. Not because the AI feels them, but because I
do them.

But let's say I can train myself to see ALL CAPS as a neutral markup, similar
to seeing *italic* in `*italic*`, **bold** in `**bold**`, čerešňa in
`\v{c}ere\v{s}\v{n}a`. It wouldn't be the first time I've built a compiler in
my brain. And let's say I can keep that framing contained: one mode for
computers, another for people.

And there is precedent for this. Even with traditional programming languages,
the code looks different based on whether it is meant to be executed by a
machine (optimized and architecture dependent) or read by a human. Is it study
material? A proof of concept? An expression of an idea shared between domain
experts or researchers?

Even if I can compartmentalize, even if there is a precedent, it still does
not feel right.

Text is how we pass down not only information, but also
culture. What is normal, expected, allowed, desired, legal, …
and what is not. To our colleagues, to our future selves,
and to those who might come after us.

By using language in certain ways we are capturing the present
to become the future's past, and that way shaping the future.

I don't want to manifest a future where yelling is normal.

More thoughts on the topic have not taken concrete form in my mind yet.
I might add something later.
