![Looking at things past through numbers coincidentally collected](/images/reflection.png)

On an occasion it is good to turn around, look at things past, and reflect.
Ponder on how things went and what can be learned for the future.
Contemplate what was good and where things changed the direction.
Perhaps there are things that were impossible to notice up-close.
Meditate on what knowledge can be extracted from collected data.

However don't spend too much time turned to past.
When there is time to let go do so.
Just keep things worth keeping.
